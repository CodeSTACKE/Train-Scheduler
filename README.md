###### Train-Scheduler
------------------------------
In this assignment, i  created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.my app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

I have used Firebase database for the storage of the train details.Jquery for dynamically creating the html for display the data.
